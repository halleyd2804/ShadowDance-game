This is a music arcade game called ShadowDance in the Java programming language.
The objective is straightforward: players must accurately hit the musical notes appearing on different lanes within a given time to accumulate points. 
To progress to the next level, players need to surpass a specified target score. In the second level, there is a unique lane featuring special notes like bombs, speed-ups, slow-downs, and double-score notes.
The complexity increases in the third level, introducing enemies attempting to steal notes and a guardian that shoots projectiles at these enemies when a key is pressed. 
Can you achieve the target scores and emerge victorious in the game?
